gwydion-dylan (2.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * About 100 people have promised to package this and not followed through.  I'd 
    like this to get into Debian *someday*, so I've packaged it.  If you feel like
    this is unfair drop me an e-mail.
  * Initial release, bootstrapped with Mindy.  Future release will depend on this
    release (or newer) to build from source.
