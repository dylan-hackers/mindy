make-dylan-app \- Create a new Dylan program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B make-dylan-app
.RI appname
.SH WARNING
This man page is intended to supplement the main Gwydion Dylan
documentation at
.IR http://www.gwydiondylan.org/ .
It provides an incomplete reference of the available options. For a full
reference or a tutorial, please see the web site.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B make-dylan-app
creates a directory
.I appname
containing a minimal Dylan application that can be compiled with
.IR d2c (1)
or interpreted with
.IR mindy (1).
This makes it unnecessary to understand the Dylan ``library interchange
definition'' just to compile a simple program.
.PP
The generated program includes three files:
.IR appname .lid,
.IR appname \-exports.dylan
and
.IR appname .dylan.
The first file describes the program in fashion allegedly understood by
different Dylan environments, the second contains library import and export
declarations, and the third contains actual source code.
.PP
An effort has been made to include libraries suitable for writing small,
command-line applications.

Much more extensive documentation in various formats is available through
