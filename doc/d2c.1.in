.SH NAME
d2c \- A Dylan-to-C compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B d2c
.RI "[ " option " ].\|.\|. " lidfile 
.SH WARNING
This man page is intended to supplement the main Gwydion Dylan
documentation at
.IR http://www.gwydiondylan.org/ .
It provides an incomplete reference of the available options. For a full
reference or a tutorial, please see the web site.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B d2c
is an aggressively optimizing Dylan compiler which generates C code. Under
normal cicumstances, it will then automatically invoke your C compiler to
generate native executables.
.PP
.B d2c
supports nearly all of the Dylan language, including the macro system. It
can interface with C using
.IR melange (1)\c
, and can compile code developed under the
.IR mindy (1)
Dylan interpreter.
.SH PROGRAM STRUCTURE
A Dylan program is made up out of one or more libraries. Each library
contains one or more modules, each of which can be defined in one or more
source files.
.B d2c
compiles an entire library at once and performs aggressive
inter-file optimizations.
.PP
You describe a library by creating a
.B lid
(library interchange definition) file which lists the files to be compiled and any relevant options. You
then feed this file through
.B d2c
to produce a static library or an executable (shared library support is
being debugged at the moment).
.PP
You can use the
.IR make-dylan-app (1)
script to create a sample Dylan program composed of a
.B lid
file and an empty main function.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-\-help"
Print out a message describing the available options.
.TP
.BR "\-\-version"
Print out the version and copyright.
.TP
.BI "\-i, \-\-interactive"
Enter interactive evaluation of Dylan expressions.
.TP
.BI "\-L, \-\-libdir" " libdir"
Specify an extra directory to search for compiled Dylan libraries.
.TP
.BI "\-D, \-\-define" " feature"
Define a conditional-compilation feature which can be tested with #if.
.TP
.BI "\-U, \-\-undefine" " feature"
Undefine a conditional-compilation feature which can be tested with #if.
.TP
.BR "\-M, \-\-log\-deps"
Write
.IR make (1)\c
\-style dependency information to a file when compiling. You can then
include this file into your Makefiles.
.TP
.BR "\-T, \-\-target" " target"
Generate code for the platform named
.BI target
instead of the native platform.
.TP
.BI "\-p, \-\-platforms" " descriptions"
Get platform descriptions from the file
.BI descriptions
instead of the standard
.IR platforms.descr (4)
file.
.TP
.BR "\-\-no\-binaries"
Do not compile generated C files. Often used in conjunction with
.BR -T .
.TP
.BR "\-d, \-\-break"
Halt the compiler upon encountering an error. This is generally used when
debugging
.B d2c
itself.
.TP
.BI "\-F, \-\-cc\-override\-command" " command"
Use
.IR command
to invoke the C compiler on certain source files (see below). This can be
used to work around bugs in the native C compiler by passing non-standard
options.
.TP
.BI "\-f, \-\-cc\-override\-file" " file"
Mark
.IR file
as using a non\-standard command to invoke the C compiler (see above).
.TP
.BR "\-g, \-\-debug"
Try to generate binaries suitable for debugging. At the moment, that means
including all declared functions in the generated code.
.TP
.BR "\-s, \-\-static"
Force programs to link against static libraries. This will become more
useful once shared libraries are supported, of course.
.TP
.BR "\-\-dump\-transforms"
Display way, way too much information about what
.B d2c
is doing. If you suspect you've found an optimizer bug, this is the place
to start looking.
.SH BUGS
.B d2c
runs very slowly. We need to profile it and speed things up by about an
order of magnitude. Harlequin Dylan shows this is possible.
.PP
It would be nice to support compilation of single-file Dylan programs,
source\-level debugging and incremental compilation. Shared library support
needs to be fixed, and an efficient solution for the fragile base class
problem should be found.
.PP
Certain obscure Dylan features are missing, most notably support for
creating classes at runtime.
.PP
Other bugs can be found on the website.
