.SH WARNING
This man page is intended to supplement the main Gwydion Dylan
documentation at
.IR http://www.gwydiondylan.org/ .
It provides an incomplete reference of the available options. For a full
reference or a tutorial, please see the web site.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR mindycomp " and " mindy
are a bytecode compiler and interpreter, respectively. Dylan sources are
compiled with mindycomp and then run using mindy.
.PP
.B mindy
supports much of the Dylan language. (The most notable exclusion is the
macro system.) It provides debugging facilities and a listener. Mindy can
interface with C using
.IR melange (1)\c
, and can be used to develop programs which will later be compiled under
.IR d2c (1).
.SH PROGRAM STRUCTURE
A Dylan program is made up out of one or more libraries. Each library
contains one or more modules, each of which can be defined in one or more
source files.
.B mindycomp
compiles one file into bytecodes at a time (and doesn't particularly
understand what's it's seeing, so many errors will go unnoticed).
.PP
All the bytecode files from a library are then passed to
.BR mindy ,
which automatically supplements them with any necessary system libraries and
calls the generic function
.BR main .
You can use the
.IR make-dylan-app (1)
script to create a sample Dylan program. (It will also create a sample
.B lid
file for use with
.IR d2c (1),
but this can be ignored.)
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are shared by both mindycomp and mindy:
.TP
.BR "\-\-help"
Print out a message describing the available options.
.TP
.BR "\-\-version"
Print out the version and copyright.
.TP
.BI \-l library
Assume source or bytecode file belongs to
.IR library .
(Can this also be specified with the "library:" keyword in a source file?)
.PP
The following options are specific to mindycomp:
.TP
.BI \-D feature
Define a conditional-compilation feature which can be tested with #if.
.TP
.BI \-U feature
Undefine a conditional-compilation feature which can be tested with #if.
.TP
.BI "\-o " dbcfile
Output bytecodes to
.IR dbcfile .
Defaults to the input filename with the extension changed to ".dbc".
.PP
The following options are specific to mindy:
.TP
.BI "\-f " dbcfile
Load bytecodes from
.I dbcfile
into Mindy's heap before running.
.TP
.BI "\-x " dbcfile
The same as above, but do not look for any other options after this
point. This option allows mindy to pass
.B \-f
options to the program being run.
.TP
.I arguments
All remaining arguments are passed to the program being run.
.SH BUGS
.B mindy
does not support several major features of the Dylan language, most notably
macros. It also cannot create C-callable function pointers.
.PP
Other bugs can be found on the website.
