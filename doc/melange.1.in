.SH NAME
melange \- Translates C headers into Dylan
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B d2c
.RB "[" -v "] [" --mindy "|" --d2c "] [" -I\c
.IR includedir "].\|.\|. " infile " [" outfile "]"
.SH WARNING
This man page is intended to supplement the main Gwydion Dylan
documentation at
.IR http://www.gwydiondylan.org/ .
It provides an incomplete reference of the available options. For a full
reference or a tutorial, please see the web site.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B melange
parses C headers and emits equivalent Dylan interfaces. The current version
can handle some fairly ugly headers, but not everything found on the
average Unix system. Melange actually contains a full-fledged C
preprocessor and a C parser. Unlike many similar tools, it's not just doing
simple pattern matching--it's actually trying to emulate the front end of a
C compiler.
.PP
Eventually, we want Melange to handle any header which GCC can parse. For
the time being, generating interfaces is more of an art, and any large set
of headers is virtually gauranteed to find a new bug. Please report every
bug you encounter to
.IR gd-bugs@randomhacks.com ,
preferably with a short example. We're trying to locate and fix all the
problems, and should respond fairly quickly.
.SH IMPORTING HEADERS
To import a header named foo.h, you'll probably want to add a new module to
your exports.dylan file. Call it foo-interface. Make sure your library
uses melange-support, and that foo-interface uses the module of the same
name:
.Ds
library: my-application

define library my-application
  use dylan;
  use melange-support;
end library;

define module my-application
  use dylan;
  use melange-support;
  use foo-interface;
end module;

define module foo-interface
  use dylan;
  use melange-support;
  export
    /* All the things you want from foo.h. */;
end module;
.De
.PP
Next, create a file called foo-intr.intr which appears as follows:
.Ds
module: foo-interface

define interface
  #include "foo.h";
end interface;
.De
.PP
Type
.B melange -v foo-intr.intr foo-intr.dylan
to process the header file. Then add foo-intr.dylan to your lid file and
recompile your program.
.PP
There are many other things which can be added to an interface definition
to control imports, rename symbols, express relationships between types and
define preprocessor macros. These are described in detail by the Melange
manual (which is available through the website).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-\-help"
Print out a message describing the available options.
.TP
.BR "\-\-version"
Print out the version and copyright.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Print out the name of each C declaration as Melange processes it. This
should help find where Melange crashed, choked or got confused.
.TP
.BR \-\-d2c ", " \-\-mindy
Only generate code for one environment or the other. The default is to
generate code for both.
.TP
.BR "\-I, \-\-include\-dir" " dir"
Search
.I dir
for C headers.
.SH BUGS
Lots of them. Everywhere. We're fixing them as quickly as we can. (See the
bug tracker on the website for an up-to-date list.)
.PP
In particular, it would be desirable for melange to search include
directories in exactly the fashion as a given platform's C compiler.
