/* Dylan Range Class Definition

   Objects of the class <range> represent linear arithmetic sequences
   (here sequence is the mathematical term as well as the collection
   term).  Ranges are special collections because they may be
   infinitely long.

   A range is defined by six keyword arguments to the constructor
   function RANGE -- from:, by:, to:, above:, below:, and size:.  Any
   of these may be given or omitted; the behavior of the range depends
   on the combination of keywords given.  The FROM and BY keywords
   have default values 0 and 1 respectively.  The range created begins
   at FROM and increases by an increment of BY.

   The endpoint of the range is determined by the combination of the
   to:, above:, below:, and size: keywords.  TO is an inclusive bound
   independent of the direction of the range.  ABOVE is an exclusive
   lower bound and BELOW is and exclusive upper bound.  The range will
   have no more than SIZE elements.

   The range representation used in this code is simplified so that
   only the from, by, and a size value need to be stored.  The
   original representation (using TO, ABOVE, or whatever) is
   translated to this representation by the function
   COMPUTE-RANGE-SIZE.

// <range> -- public
//
// The <range> abstract class represents ranges (linear arithmetic
// sequences).  The class has slots to store the FROM and BY
// parameters of the range and a virtual slot RANGE-DIRECTION.
//
// The concrete subclasses that implement the range protocol are
// <bounded-range> and <unbounded-range>.

// This implements the virtual slot RANGE-DIRECTION.  Returns the

/* Range Utility Functions

   This section contains functions that are used to do the computation
   needed to set up a range.  Such computations include figuring out
   what the size of a range should be given its FROM, BY, TO, ABOVE,
   BELOW, and SIZE parameters.

*/

// compute-range-size -- internal
//
// This function translates the (from, by, to, above, below, size)
// representation of the user to the (from, by, size) (bounded) or
// (from, by) (unbounded) internal representation.
//
// The size returned by COMPUTE-RANGE-SIZE is the smallest range size
// such that:
// 1) the first (if any) element of the range is FROM and its
//    increment is BY
// 2) the range has no element less than ABOVE or greater than BELOW
// 3) the range has no element greater than TO + BY if BY is positive,
//    or no element less than TO + BY if BY is negative
// 4) the size of the range is no greater than SIZE
//
// Size limitations for each of the arguments are computed.  Valid
// sizes (sizes not #f) are taken.
//
// If there are no valid sizes, #f is returned.  (Everywhere in this
// implementation of ranges, a size of #f denotes an unbounded range.)
// If valid sizes exists the maximum of 0 and the minimum of the valid
// sizes is returned.

                          Range Intersection

   INTERSECTION for ranges is required to return even for unbounded
   ranges.  So the algorithm used for range intersection must be able
   to find an intersection for unbounded ranges.  Fortunately this is
   not too hard with the representation of ranges used here.

   The steps of finding the intersection of two ranges are:

   1) Find the interval in which the two ranges must intersect.  This
      interval may be infinitely long in one direction.

   2) If the interval is finite, find the finite intersection of the
      two ranges within that interval.

      If the interval is infinite, find the unbounded increasing or
      decreasing (one or the other) intersection of the two ranges
      within that interval.

   The functions to do these steps are defined below.  Step 1 is
   performed by INTERSECTION-INTERVAL.  Step 2 is performed by one of
   FINITE-INTERSECTION, INCREASING-INTERSECTION, or
   DECREASING-INTERSECTION.
