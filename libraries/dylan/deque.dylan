//; Dylan Deque Class Definition

// The <deque> class defines double ended queues.  A deque allows accesses
// from both ends of the queue.  Used with PUSH and POP, a deque may be
// treated as a stack.  When PUSH-LAST and POP-LAST are used, more
// complicated things can be done.  And the regular sequence and
// collection operations allow one to work with the deque as a whole.
// This implementation of deques uses element objects with pointers to
// represent the deque.

// <deque-element> -- internal
//
// Each <deque-element> has a DEQUE-ELEMENT-DATA slot and slots for the
// previous and next deque elements.  If there is no PREV-DEQUE-ELEMENT or
// NEXT-DEQUE-ELEMENT, the marker #f should be used in these slots.
//
define class <deque-element> (<object>)
  slot deque-element-data, init-keyword: #"data";
  slot prev-deque-element = #f;
  slot next-deque-element = #f;
end class <deque-element>;

// Note: When union types make it into Dylan, if it's possible we will
// want to type the previous and next slots of deque-elements.

// <deque> -- public
//
// Deque objects have slots for the head and tail of the queue.  The
// DEQUE-HEAD and DEQUE-TAIL of a deque must always be instances of
// <deque-element>; except when the deque is empty, in which case
// DEQUE-HEAD and DEQUE-TAIL must both be #f.  This invariant must always
// be preserved by the deque functions.
//
define class <deque> (<stretchy-collection>, <mutable-sequence>)
  slot size :: <integer> = 0, setter: deque-size-setter;
  slot deque-head = #f;
  slot deque-tail = #f;
end class <deque>;

// Note: When union types make it into Dylan we will want to use these
// here to type the DEQUE-HEAD and DEQUE-TAIL.

// Note: In the code that follows, the terms "state" and "element" will be
// used interchangeably to denote <deque-element> objects.  The choice of
// term used will usually depend on the context.  If the object is used as
// a pointer into the deque structure, the term "state" will probably be
// used.  If it is used as containing a piece of deque data, the term
// "element" may be used.

// Deque operations -- public
//
// These are the main functions to use with deques.

//; Iteration Protocol

// States in the iteration protocol are deque-elements from the deque that

// Sequence Function Methods

// More of the sequence functions have been specialized for deques because
// they are improved more than the general collection functions by
// knowledge of the data structure.
//
// Especially useful are the specializations of the mutator functions
// (ones that end in !) which are allowed to change the data structure.
// These can be made very space and time efficient for deques.  However,
// the code for these functions also looks messier because it grunges
// around with the structure of the deque object.
//
// Other functions will usually use either recursive helper functions
// (especially those with funny keys for counting the number of things to
// remove and so forth, because it is easier to deal with things that way)
// or more abstract forms such as for-each.
//
// Some of the sequence functions have been specialized not for
// efficiency, but for order stability.  Since deques are by nature an
// ordered data structure, order should be preserved in deque operations,
// and this cannot be guaranteed in the general sequence methods.
