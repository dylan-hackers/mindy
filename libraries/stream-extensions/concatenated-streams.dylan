// An input stream which is a wrapper for several input streams.
// Reading from a <concatenated-stream> is equivalent to reading from
// the first component stream, then on eof silently rolling over into
// the second stream, etc.  Because wrapper-streams are broken, there
// must be at least one component stream.  (ie, because the
// inner-stream slot only accepts <stream> rather than
// false-or(<stream>)...)
//
define sealed class <concatenated-stream> (<wrapper-stream>)
  // get-next-stream takes no args and returns false-or(<stream>), the
  // false being if there are no more streams.  close(<combo-stream>)
  // will change this slot to be a function that returns a "stream
  // closed you moron" error.
