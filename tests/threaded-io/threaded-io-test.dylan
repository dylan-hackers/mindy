// This is a simple test of threads in the presence of streams.  It is
// meant to test the strength of the C select() function in
// interp/driver.c (select is provided by the operating system, but on
// some non-Unix platforms is not very good).

// This program reads from three streams simultaneously and echos them
// all to standard output, interlacing the results character by
// character.  One file is called "asterixes.txt" and consists of
// nothing but asterixes, the second is "dashes.txt" and is nothing
// but dashes, and the third file is standard input.  When you're
// tired of running it, hit control-C and quit out of the debugger
// with "quit".

// What you should see: Until you type something at the keyboard, you
// should see asterixes and dashes in approximately equal proportions.
// When you type something, before you hit return it'll appear in the
// input stream in places dictated by your typing speed.  When you hit
// return, this program will read it in and output it amoung the
// asterixes and dashes.

// Sample output:
//
// -*-*-*-*-*-*-*A-*A-A*-*-*-*-*-*-*\n-A-A-A*\n-*-*-*-*-*-
//               ^^^^^^             ^
//   Here I quickly typed in       Here I hit return
//   three A's

//   (\n will be replaced by a newline character)

// If the output is not appearing continuously, it means that Mindy
// has blocked on one of the input streams (probably
// *standard-input*), which means that select() is faulty.
